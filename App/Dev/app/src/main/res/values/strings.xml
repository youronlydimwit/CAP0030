    <string name="about_batik">Batik is a technique of wax-resist dyeing applied to whole cloth,
                                or cloth made using this technique. Batik is made either by drawing
                                dots and lines of the resist with a spouted tool called a canting,
                                or by printing the resist with a copper stamp called a cap. The applied
                                wax resists dyes and therefore allows the artisan to colour selectively
                                by soaking the cloth in one colour, removing the wax with boiling water,
                                and repeating if multiple colours are desired.
                                A tradition of making batik is found in various countries, including Indonesia,
                                Singapore, Malaysia, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Nigeria; the batik of Indonesia,
                                however, is the best-known. Indonesian batik made in the island of Java has a long
                                history of acculturation, with diverse patterns influenced by a variety of cultures,
                                and is the most developed in terms of pattern, technique, and the quality of workmanship.
                                In October 2009, UNESCO designated Indonesian batik as a Masterpiece of Oral and
                                Intangible Heritage of Humanity.</string>
