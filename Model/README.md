## Models
We have saved our models into two formats; **SavedModel** format and **TFLite** format.
Instructions on how to build the model is in the **notebooks** above.

### 1 - SavedModel
Apparently it is too big to upload to github, and so we uploaded it to drive folder instead.
Here's the model file in [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pVRpvywVybsK54okj6nB21P5qGprsEE5?usp=sharing)

### 2 - TFLite
For the TFLite format you can find the "**modelv2.tflite**" file above.
